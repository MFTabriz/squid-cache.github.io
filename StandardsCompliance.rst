= Standards Compliance in Squid =

'''Synopsis'''

Squid behaviour is governed by a great many International standards and requirements. Below is a list of the standards to which Squid is expected to obey and an indication of whether we believe it does.

  * This list was updated 2021-08-15. Details are believed to be accurate for the current release 5.1 or later.

 {i} this list is known to be incomplete. If you are aware of anything important which has been omitted please [[http://bugs.squid-cache.org/|report it]] as a website bug.

== Formal Certifications ==

## There are a bunch of certifications which Enterprise need. Surely somebody has already paid for them.

At this point there are none on record. We are looking for information and possibly sponsorship to obtain any certifications which are required for use in your network.
