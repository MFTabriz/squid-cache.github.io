== Rafael Pivato ==

As a network administrator I used Squid as the key point to give Internet access to my users.

My current work here will be helping the community with my best providing nice and clean documentation in this Wiki.

During this process I expect to learn even more about Squid-Cache to provide higher quality consultancy services.
