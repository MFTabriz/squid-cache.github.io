Email: <<MailTo(squid3@treenet.co.nz)>>

I joined the Squid development community in January 2007 intending to just complete a then-partial [[../Features/IPv6|IPv6]] feature branch and was promoted to the Core Developer team mid-May of that year. Being the sucker that I am, I also tripped my way into the position of release maintainer for [[../RoadMap/Squid3|Squid-3]] early in 2008, then kicked off the [[../Translations|Translation Project]] a few months later.

I run a Web Development and Hosting business [[http://www.treenet.co.nz]]; Treehouse Networks Ltd. in New Zealand.

Here is an ''auto-generated'' list of my current public Squid projects:
