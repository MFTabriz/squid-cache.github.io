I joined the Squid development community in Januray 2007 intending to just complete a then-partial IPv6 feature branch and was forcibly promoted to the Core Developer team mid-May of that year. Being the sucker that I am, I also tripped my way into the position of maintainer for Squid-3 early in 2008.

I run a Web Development business [[http://www.treenet.co.nz]]; Treehouse Networks Ltd. in New Zealand.

Here is an ''auto-generated'' list of my current public Squid projects:
