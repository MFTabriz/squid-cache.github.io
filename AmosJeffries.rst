Email: [[MailTo(squid3@treenet.co.nz)]]

I joined the Squid Development community in Januray 2007 intending to just complete a then-partial IPv6 feature branch and was forcibly promoted to the Core Developer team mid-May of that year.
 I run a Web development business [http://www.treenet.co.nz]; Treehouse Networks Ltd. in New Zealand.
