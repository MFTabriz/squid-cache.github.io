Email: <<MailTo(squid3@treenet.co.nz)>>

I joined the Squid development community in January 2007 intending to just complete a then-partial [[../Features/IPv6|IPv6]] feature branch and was promoted to the Core Developer team mid-May of that year. Being the sucker that I am, I also tripped my way into the position of release maintainer for Squid-3 early in 2008, then kicked off the [[Translations|Translation Project]] a few months later.

I run an IT Consulting business [[http://www.treenet.co.nz]]; Treehouse Networks Ltd. in New Zealand.  Which provides customers from around the world with a web hosting, email and content delivery network (CDN) built with Squid.

A few bits and pieces about Squid including PayPal donations to me can be found at [[http://www.treenet.co.nz/projects/squid/]]

Here is an ''auto-generated'' list of my current public Squid projects:
