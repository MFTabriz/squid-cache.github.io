== Compiling ==

## Describe the configure options and command line needed to build and install Squid

## by Adam W. Dace.

Squid compiles on Mac OS X.  However, there are some steps required before following the general build instructions.

 * '''Install Xcode'''
  1. From Mac OS X, run the "AppStore" application.
  2. Locate "Xcode", Apple's development environment.
  3. Install "Xcode".

 * '''Install Command-Line Tools'''
  1. Launch "Xcode".
  2. Open "Xcode | Preferences".
  3. Bring up the "Downloads" tab.
  4. Under "Components" click the "Install" button for "Command Line Tools".
  5. Quit Xcode.

 * '''Verify Command-Line Tools'''
  1. Launch "Terminal", usually located in the "Utilities" folder under "Applications".
  2. Run "gcc --version".  Manually verify this produces sane output.

From this point, the [[SquidFaq/CompilingSquid#How_do_I_compile_Squid.3F|general build instructions]] should be all you need.


 . /!\ It is worth noting this platform doesn't support EUI. The --enable-eui ./configure will cause build errors.


## Followed by any special patching needed.
## Please inform upstream so we can simplify this to a configure option and obsolete the patching

== Troubleshooting ==

## Series of errors that may be seen. Only if unique to this OS.
##  Cross-OS errors go in Features with the relevant feature.
## Followed by a description of what it means and the solution if known.
