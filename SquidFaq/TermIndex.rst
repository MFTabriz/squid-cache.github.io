== Neighbor ==


In Squid, ''neighbor'' usually means the same thing as ''peer''.
A neighbor cache is one that you have defined with the ''cache_peer'' configuration
option.  Neighbor refers to either a parent or a sibling.


In Harvest 1.4, neighbor referred to what Squid calls a sibling.  That is, Harvest
had ''parents'' and ''neighbors''.  For backward compatability, the term
neighbor is still accepted in some Squid configuration options.
