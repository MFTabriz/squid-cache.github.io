== Do you have pre-compiled binaries available? ==
The squid core team members do not have the resources to make pre-compiled binaries available. Instead, we invest effort into making the source code very portable and rely on others to provide such packaging as needed.

== How do I install a binary for ... ==
Most operating system distributions provide packages in the formats appropriate for direct install on those systems. Please thank them.
