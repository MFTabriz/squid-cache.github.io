You need to use different <code>tcp_outgoing_address</code>es  to mark the packets intended for different upstream providers. You then need to use policy routing on the host running Squid to correctly route packets to the correct uplink provider. Some information on how to do it on Linux systems can be found at <ulink url="http://lukecyca.com/2004/09/28/howto-multirouting-with-linux/"/>. </para><!--rule (<hr>) is not applicable to DocBook--><para> Back to the <ulink url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/NetworkOptimizations/SquidFaq#">SquidFaq</ulink> </para></section></article>
