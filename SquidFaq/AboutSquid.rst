== What is Squid? ==


Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients, supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects.  Unlike  traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process.

Squid keeps meta data and especially hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request logging.  By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocol, Squid caches can be arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth savings.

Squid consists of a main server program ''squid'', an optional Domain Name System lookup program ''dnsserver'' (squid nowadays implements the DNS protocol on its own by default), some optional programs for rewriting requests and performing authentication, and some management and client tools.

Squid is originally derived from the ARPA-funded [http://webharvest.sourceforge.net/ng/ Harvest project].
Since then it has gone through many changes and has many new features.


== What is Internet object caching? ==

Internet object caching is a way to store requested Internet objects (i.e., data available via the HTTP, FTP, and gopher protocols) on a system closer to the requesting site than to the source. Web browsers can then use the local Squid cache as a proxy HTTP server, reducing access time as well as bandwidth consumption.


== Why is it called Squid? ==

Harris' Lament says, "All the good ones are taken."

We needed to distinguish this new version from the Harvest cache software.  Squid was the code name for initial development, and it stuck.


== What is the latest version of Squid? ==

At the present time, Squid-2.5 is the stable version and Squid-3.0 is under development. There have been talks of a ["Squid-2.6"] version but at this time it's unclear when (and if) it will ever see the light.

Please see [http://www.squid-cache.org/ the Squid home page] for the most recent versions.

[http://www.acmeconsulting.it/SquidNT/ Guido Serassio]
maintains the native NT port of Squid and is actively working on having the needed changes integrated into the standard Squid distribution. Partially based on earlier NT port by

== Does Squid support SSL/HTTPS/TLS? ==


As of version 2.5, Squid can terminate SSL connections.  This is perhaps
only useful in a surrogate (http accelerator) configuration.  You must
run configure with ''--enable-ssl''.  See ''https_port'' in
squid.conf for more information.


Squid also supports these encrypted protocols by "tunneling"
traffic between clients and servers.  In this case, Squid can relay
the encrypted bits between a client and a server.


Normally, when your browser comes across an ''https'' URL, it
does one of two things:



  - The browser opens an SSL connection directly to the origin server.
  - The browser tunnels the request through Squid with the ''CONNECT'' request method.

The ''CONNECT'' method is a way to tunnel any kind of
connection through an HTTP proxy.  The proxy doesn't
understand or interpret the contents.  It just passes
bytes back and forth between the client and server.
For the gory details on tunnelling and the CONNECT
method, please see
[ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2817.txt RFC 2817]
and

== What's the legal status of Squid? ==


Squid is copyrighted by the University of California San Diego.
Squid uses some [http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/FAQ/squid-credits.txt code developed by others].

Squid is [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html Free Software], licensed under the terms of the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License].


== Is Squid year-2000 compliant? ==

We made the following fixes in to address the year 2000 issue:

  * ''cache.log'' timestamps use 4-digit years instead of just 2 digits.
  * ''parse_rfc1123()'' assumes years less than "70" are after 2000.
  * ''parse_iso3307_time()'' checks all four year digits.

Year-2000 fixes were applied to the following Squid versions:

  * [http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.1/ squid-2.1]: Year parsing bug fixed for dates in the "Wed Jun  9 01:29:59 1993 GMT" format (Richard Kettlewell).
  * squid-1.1.22:  Fixed likely year-2000 bug in ftpget's timestamp parsing (Henrik Nordstrom).
  * squid-1.1.20: Misc fixes (Arjan de Vet).

Patches:

  * [http://www.squid-cache.org/Y2K/patch3 Richard's lib/rfc1123.c patch]. If you are still running 1.1.X, then you should apply this patch to your source and recompile.
  * [http://www.squid-cache.org/Y2K/patch2 Henrik's src/ftpget.c patch].
  * [http://www.squid-cache.org/Y2K/patch1 Arjan's lib/rfc1123.c patch].

Squid-2.2 and earlier versions have a
[http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.2/bugs/index.html#squid-2.2.stable5-mkhttpdlogtime-end-of-year New Year bug].  This is not strictly a Year-2000 bug; it would happen on the first day of any year.
