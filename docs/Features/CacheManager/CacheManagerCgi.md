# This Cache Manager CGI tool

This is tool that provides basic management capabilities of a Squid
server through a HTML user interface.
As every
[Common_Gateway_Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface),
software, it requires an HTTP server to make it really run.

The communication with the Squid server is made up using the
[Cache Object Protocol](/Features/CacheManager/CacheObjectScheme), that provides access to the underlying
[Cache Manager](/Features/CacheManager).

More information is currently available at
[Features/CacheManager](/Features/CacheManager).
