# Feature: IPv6 delay pool type

- **Goal**: Current delay pool types are quite heavily geared for
    IPv4. A new type is needed to properly support IPv6. Ideally the new
    pool should be CIDR-aware, as the existing pool types are quite
    dependent on natural netmask boundaries.
- **Status**: *Not started*
- **ETA**: *unknown*
- **Version**: 3.3
- **Priority**:
- **Developer**:
- **More**: Bug
