# Third Party Modules in Squid

Squid offers many different interfaces and API for extension, and has
for quite some time. The number and power of these interfaces has grown
in time, as has their usefulness. Finding those plugins may be a hard
task for the interested users; the purpose of this page is to help
extension modules' authors make their work known to users.

> :warning: 
    The Squid Development Team cannot in any way offer any warranty,
    or take any responsibility, on any third-party code. 
    e did not write it, and we cannot support nor maintain it.

## Self-distributed modules

Authors who wish to self-distribute their add-on modules can publish a
feature-like page pointing to their work in the [Third-party modules registry](#modules-registry).

There are several providers such as [github](https://github.com), 
[sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net) or [launchpad](https://launchpad.net)
that can be used to host modules.
This wiki can be used to [help with discoverability](/ContributeToWiki)


## Bundled modules

The Squid Team is also open to requests from third-parties to bundle
extension modules with the Squid releases. We are currently developing a
set of guidelines to help ease the distribution integration. Until they
are finalized, we ask interested parties to them for tracking and apply
with the project [MergeProcedure](/MergeProcedure).

# Modules Registry
