I'm involved with squid development since 2000, I've been working mainly in the autentication area and on integration with Microsoft windows authentication systems.

Besides this, I'm a general nag-person for the other developers and I'm this wiki's admin.

I'm also known by the nickname "Kinkie".

There's a playground for new features available at /LabArea

I'm reachable by email at <<MailTo(kinkie@squid-cache.org)>>

   :: seems to be an interesting on-disk associative-array database (a la dbm, ndbm, gdbm, qdbm), it claims to be very fast. Might it be useful to store data or metadata?

== Random pointers ==

I'm investigating the possibility of importing IRC logs into the wiki.
