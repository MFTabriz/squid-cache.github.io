I'm involved with squid development since 2000, I've been working mainly in the autentication area and on integration with Microsoft windows authentication systems.

Besides this, I'm a general nag-person for the other developers and I'm this wiki's admin.

I'm also known by the nickname "Kinkie".

There's a playground for new features available at /LabArea.
Random bits at /NotePad, along with some /RemindersToSelf

I'm reachable by email at <<MailTo(kinkie@squid-cache.org)>>
