There is no restriction for this traffic to flow symetricly towards the target host. </para><para>A reverse path is a path, or can be sometimes identified by the router &quot;port&quot;, that is not the main for the router traffic to flow throw towards the network. </para><para>As an example a router that has 3 interfaces with 3 IP addresses and which interface 1 is the main traffic pipe of the network but also this router allows another path of incomming packets towards it's network. </para></section><section><title>What is Reverse Path Filtering?</title></section></article>
