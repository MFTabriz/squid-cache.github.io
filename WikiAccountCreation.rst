In order to prevent the time and resources drain that wiki spam would cause, we need to restrict user account creation (and consequently, write access to this wiki) to those the maintainers can identify as a real person.

In order to request a new account, please write to <<MailTo(kinkie AT squid-cache DOT org,the wiki admin)>>; please remember to supply your name or nickname, your desired user-id (in !CamelCase if possible); the mail address you use to send the mail will be recorded as your contact address.

Creating a personal account is needed to subscribe for page change notifications and to write to the wiki; everything else can be accessed as anonymous users.

We are looking forward to lift these restrictions as more antispam features will be added to the wiki engine.
