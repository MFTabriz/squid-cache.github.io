== Current Features ==

For the currently configurable features see the SquidFaq

== Future ==
Here is an ''auto-generated'' list of features that are not yet completed or started.

A timeline of feature integration is listed on the [[../RoadMap/Squid3|Squid-3 RoadMap]]

## When completed yes|no metadata is inserted into features we could use this...
<<FullSearch(title:Features/ regex:completed.no )>>

<<FullSearch(category:CategoryFeature title:Features/ regex:Status...: -regex:Status[^A-z]+completed -regex:Status[^A-z]+Obsolete -regex:completed.no -regex:completed.yes )>>


Less documented ideas and wishes are available [[Features/Other|elsewhere]].

The definition of a feature is discussed [[CategoryFeature|elsewhere]].
