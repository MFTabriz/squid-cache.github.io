Short report on the code sprint which took place in October 2005

Participants:

  * HenrikNordstr√∂m
  * FrancescoChemolli (kinkie)
  * GuidoSerassio

Primary goal:

  * Port NegotiateAuthentication support from the negotiate-2.5 branch to Squid-3.

Secondary goals:

  * Hack on whatever projects come up
  * Have fun

Accomplishments:

  * NegotiateAuthentication fully merged to HEAD
  * ["Squid-2.6"] development cycle started
  * [wiki:Self:NiceLittleProjects#connectionpinning ConnectionPinning] implemented

Failures:

  * We did not manage to get Samba-4 running for the Negotiate tests. Instead a [:NegotiateAuthentication:Windows host was used to verify the authentication exchanges].
  * UPDATE: using latest Samba-4 snapshot (04-Nov-2005) Negotiate support now seems to work.
