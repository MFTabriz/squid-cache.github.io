The '''Cache Manager CGI''' is a tool that provides basic management capabilities of a Squid server through a HTML user interface. As every WikiPedia:Common_Gateway_Interface, it requires an HTTP server like [http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/ thttpd] to make it really run.

The communication with the Squid server is made up using the [:CacheObjectProtocol:Cache Object Protocol], that provides access to the underlying [:CacheManager:Cache Manager].

More information is currently available at SquidFaq/CacheManager.
