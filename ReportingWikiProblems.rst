= Reporting Wiki Problems =

If you experience problems with the wiki layout or engine, please file a bug in [[http://www.squid-cache.org/bugs/|Bugzilla]], using the "Website" product and "wiki" component. Please make sure to specify what browser you are using, what page you are trying to access, and if possible attach a screenshot showing the problem that you're having.

Problems with the wiki '''contents''' can be reported in the same way, but the recommended solution in this case is to get involved, please see FrontPage for information on how to do so.

Thanks!
