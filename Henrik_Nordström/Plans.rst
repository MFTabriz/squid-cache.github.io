My plans for the development of Squid

 * [:Features/Optimizations:Eleminate unneeded copying]

 * Fix up the forwarding path, allowing for [:Features/HTTP11:HTTP/1.1 (1xx)]

 * Eleminate the in-core [:Features/NoCentralStoreIndex:store index]

 * Look into how to effectively store things.

 * [:Features/StackableIO:Stackable I/O model]

 * Implement [:Features/Optimizations:scatter-gather IO]
