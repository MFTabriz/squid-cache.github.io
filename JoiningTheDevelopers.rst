== How to become a Squid developer ==

The current Squid development model makes extensive use of branches, where each developer or task is given a unique branch containing his changes. Tools are provided to almost automatically keep the development branches up to date with the main Squid version.

To become a Squid developer you need to have some knowledge of C++ code and some tools covered in [[Squid3VCS]], and then email squid-dev@squid-cache.org with your name and a short introduction on who you are and your interest in Squid development.

Developers are assumed to know and follow these simple rules (separate page)

The current developer projects are hosted by http://code.launchpad.net/squid

Older ones are hosted on devel.squid-cache.org. This service is built around the service provided by SourceForge.
