= Squid Software Foundation Board Meetings =
The [[http://foundation.squid-cache.org/|Foundation]] Board of Directors helds semi-regular meetings to discuss current Foundation affairs. This page documents the next meeting logistics (if known) and will eventually archive past meeting details.

Most of the Board discussions can be open to the public and your constructive participation is encouraged. We currently do not have a formal set of public participation rules. For now, please email Board member(s) in advance if you would like to join the discussion of any specific item(s) on the Draft Agenda. Most likely, you will need to wait on #squiddev for an invitation to join the meeting session when the item(s) you are interested in are being discussed. We will eventually formalize the procedure based on experience and demand.

Notes:

## * Nabble: This forum copy of squid-users is causing some serious issues.
##  . Posts which use certain quotation methods have elided details when they are delivered. Causing annoying and needless traffic re-questioning for details.
##  . Members subscribed to Nabble but not Squid-users have been allowed to post to the forum without the message being accepted by our mailserver. Many queries and help responses are getting "lost".
##  . Nabble members are offered the ability to erase all record of their posts to a forum. This causes the illusion that they can erase squid-users content mistakenly posted. Combined with the incomplete mesage delivery problem means whole sections of threads can be permanently lost.
##  . Is there any way we can identify who is in control of the forum and get better settings applied?
##  . NP: Hugo contacted

## * Ways to improve development efficiency: Proposed changes posted for squid-dev review often result in long, painful, discussions that drastically increase overall change "cost", discourage new development, and encourage reviewless commits (of occasionally broken or low-quality code). Is there anything we can do to improve the process without sacrificing the quality of the accepted changes?


## NOTES:
##  - Mirrors: whether to update and resume using email-broken.pl notification in Foundation name. Currently From:Duane...
