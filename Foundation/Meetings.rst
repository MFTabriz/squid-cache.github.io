= Squid Software Foundation Board Meetings =
The [[http://foundation.squid-cache.org/|Foundation]] Board of Directors helds semi-regular meetings to discuss current Foundation affairs. This page documents the next meeting logistics (if known) and will eventually archive past meeting details.

Most of the Board discussions can be open to the public and your constructive participation is encouraged. We currently do not have a formal set of public participation rules. For now, please email Board member(s) in advance if you would like to join the discussion of any specific item(s) on the Draft Agenda. Most likely, you will need to wait on #squiddev for an invitation to join the meeting session when the item(s) you are interested in are being discussed. We will eventually formalize the procedure based on experience and demand.

Notes:

 * Ways to improve development efficiency: Proposed changes posted for squid-dev review often result in long, painful, discussions that drastically increase overall change "cost", discourage new development, and encourage reviewless commits (of occasionally broken or low-quality code). Is there anything we can do to improve the process without sacrificing the quality of the accepted changes?

 * Better Board to-do list tracking: Board members may be missing discussion items that have not been converted to published action points, delaying progress on important projects in-between formal meetings. Should we consider a better way to track to-dos than the mailing list (bugzilla, a private wiki page, Basecamp, etc.)?


## NOTES:
##  - Nabble: have been allowing unsubscribed posts to "squid-users" without delivering for some time
##  - Mirrors: whether to update and resume using email-broken.pl notification in Foundation name. Currently From:Duane...
