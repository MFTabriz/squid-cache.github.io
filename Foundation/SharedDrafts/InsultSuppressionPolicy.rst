We are a community of Developers and tech enthusiasts.

We use donated resources for a common purpose, developing the Squid Web Cache.

As a community, we come together under shared values, key among them is respect.

As such, there are certain behaviours we cannot accept against members 
of the community, such as personal attacks and insults.

The Squid Software Foundation Board members have the authority, as trustees of
the systems supporting this community, have to ban anybody
engaging in abusive behaviours without warning or explanations.

Hoepfully this policy is a case of overengineering.
