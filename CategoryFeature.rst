These pages document Squid development features, including functionality, performance, and documentation improvements. The term ''feature'' is used loosely, to mean anything from a brief end-user suggestion to a code fragment, to a how-to document.

A feature description may start with a half-baked idea, morph into a high-level specification, develop into an experimental patch, become a part of the official release, be maintained and, eventually, killed. Most of these states are usually not documented, unfortunately.

Below, you will find an ''auto-generated'' list of pages related to the Feature category. For more intelligent views of features, please go [[Features|elsewhere]].
