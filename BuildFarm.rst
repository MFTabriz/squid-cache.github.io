= Squid Build Farm =
The Squid project aims to ensure compatibility with a big number of OSes. Aim of the Build Farm effort is to ensure that at least some testing is done on all platforms we can, and we rely on a number of Docker containers and virtual machines running on hosts kindly donated by volunteers and by [[http://www.digitalocean.com/|DigitalOcean]].

[[FrancescoChemolli]] is leading this effort.

Project sysadmins can find documentation on the Docker farm at [[BuildFarm/DockerBuildFarm]]. The images used to test our supported builds are available on the [[https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/squidcache/buildfarm|Docker Hub]], and are built from instructions at [[https://github.com/kinkie/dockerfiles|GitHub]] feel free to use them for your own builds.


'''Volunteer Help Sought:'''

Donations of disk space and CPU time are welcome and encouraged.

The actual testing will be coordinated by [[http://jenkins-ci.org/|Jenkins]] at [[http://build.squid-cache.org/|Our instance]]
