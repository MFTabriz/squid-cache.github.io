== Outline ==

This configuration covers the basic Reverse Proxy (Accelerator) config. More advanced configurations all build on these basic settings.

see the [[SquidFaq/ReverseProxy|FAQ Reverse Proxy]] page for detailed overview of what Reverse-Proxy and HTTP Acceleration are.

|| {i} || The accel option to SquidConf:http_port should only be specified for 2.6.STABLE8 and later. ||

|| /!\ || Accelerator mode in Squid-2.5 worked quite differently, and upgrade to 2.6 or later is strongly recommended if you still use Squid-2.5. ||

== Squid Configuration File ==

## begin locationwarning
|| /!\ || This configuration '''MUST''' appear at the top of squid.conf above any other forward-proxy configuration (http_access etc). Otherwise the standard proxy access rules block some people viewing the accelerated site. ||
## end locationwarning

First, you have to tell Squid to listen on port 80 (usually), so set the '''SquidConf:http_port''' option with the defaultsite option telling Squid it's an accelerator for this site:

{{{
http_port 80 accel defaultsite=your.main.website.name
}}}

 * '''accel''' tells Squid to handle requests coming in this port as if it was a Web Server
 * '''defaultsite=X''' tells Squid to assume the domain ''X'' was wanted when broken clients fail to send a Host: header properly.

Next, you need to tell Squid where to find the real web server:

{{{
cache_peer ip.of.webserver parent 80 0 no-query originserver name=myAccel
}}}

And finally you need to set up access controls to allow access to your site without pushing other web requests to your web server.

{{{
acl our_sites dstdomain your.main.website.name
http_access allow our_sites
cache_peer_access myAccel allow our_sites
cache_peer_access myAccel deny all
}}}
You should now be able to start Squid and it will serve requests as a HTTP server.

== Testing and Live ==

Testing of reverse-proxies should be done with Squid configured properly as it would be used in production. But the public DNS setting not pointing at it. The /etc/hosts file of a test machine can be altered to send test requests to the squid IP instead of the live webserver.

When that testing works, public DNS can be updated to send public requests to the Squid proxy instead of the master web server and Acceleration will begin immediately.
