= Traffic Interception with WCCP =

WCCP is a forwarding/tunneling method. Since a tunnel could be built using any two devices the configurations have been separated into endpoint configurations.

L2 forwarding is best suited for when the proxy is directly connected to the router. Since Layer-2 is a level below TCP/IP it can be treated as equivalent to ''Policy Routing'' at the IP layer (the difference is PBR is executes on CPU, against true L2 WCCP forwarding, which often executes on control plane level) and requires only routing configuration on the receiving proxy machine. Also note, L2 forwarding most often hardware accelerated and has no additional overhead (because uses L2 header re-writes without increasing packet), so it has best performance in most cases.

GRE tunneling is suitable for setups where the packets need to traverse multiple other devices (hops) before reaching the proxy. This requires a GRE interface configured on the receiving proxy to decapsulate the tunnel in addition to routing configuration on the receiving proxy machine.

Some older Cisco device types (notably ASA) place additional limitations on which method they support. Recent IOS versions may expand them to allow either method - or may not, check your Cisco device documentation carefully.

= Traffic Interception by Policy Routing =

Alternative to tunneling. Policy Routing is a method of passing traffic directly to the interceptor unaltered.

= Traffic Interception capture into Squid =

Once the packets reach the Squid box they still need passing into Squid. This is done by the NAT infrastructure of the operating system firewall.
