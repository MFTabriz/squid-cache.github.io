== Outline ==

In this example a squid installation will use RADIUS "squid_radius_auth" Squid RADIUS authentication helper to authenticate users before allowing them to surf the web. For security reasons users need to enter their username and password before they are allowed to surf the internet.


== Squid Installation ==

Install squid using your distro package management system or using source, make sure squid is compiled with --enable-basic-auth-helpers="squid_radius_auth" option which is only available in Squid: Version 2.6.STABLE17 and later. 

== Create radius configuration file ==

The configuration specifies how the helper connects to RADIUS. The file  contains  a  list  of directives (one per line). Lines beginning with a # is ignored. The radius configuration file will contain...

{{{
server radiusserver: specifies the name or address of the RADIUS server to connect to.

secret somesecretstring: specifies the shared RADIUS secret.

identifier nameofserver: specifies what the proxy should identify itsels as to the RADIUS server.  This directive is optional (optional)

port portnumber: Specifies the port number or  service name where the helper should connect. (default to 1812)

}}}

Here is my radius config

{{{

vi /etc/radius_config

server 192.168.10.20
secret someSecret

}}}

== Test the squid_radius_auth helper ==

Before making changes to squid.conf its better to test the helper from command line.

{{{

/usr/local/squid/libexec/squid_radius_auth -f /etc/radius_config

Or, if you are not using configuration file then ...

/usr/local/squid/libexec/squid_radius_auth -h 192.168.10.20 -w someSecret


}}}

Type your radius username/password on the same line separated with space, on successful authentication it will give "OK" otherwise "ERR login failure"

== Relevant squid.conf parameters ==

{{{

auth_param basic program /usr/local/squid/libexec/squid_radius_auth -f /etc/radius_config
auth_param basic children 5
auth_param basic realm Web-Proxy
auth_param basic credentialsttl 5 minute
auth_param basic casesensitive off

}}}

{{{

acl radius-auth proxy_auth REQUIRED
http_access allow radius-auth
http_access allow localhost
http_access deny all

}}}
