 * '''Status''': What is the current status? Standard choices are ''Not started'', ''In progress'', and ''Completed''. You can specify details after a semicolon (e.g., the reason why the development has not started yet or the first release version).

 * '''ETA''': What is the estimated time of completion? Use either number of calendar days for not started features. Use an absolute date for started and completed features. Use ''unknown'' if unknown.

 * '''Version''': What Squid version(s) will get this feature? Remove if irrelevant.

 * '''Developer''': Who is responsible for this feature? Use wiki names for developers who have a home page on this wiki.
