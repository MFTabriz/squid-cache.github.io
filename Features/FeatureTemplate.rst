## Remove this entry once the feature has been merged into trunk.
##  it will then be auto-listed in the RoadMap completed features for its Version
 * '''ETA''': What is the estimated time of completion? Use either number of calendar days for not started features. Use an absolute date for started and completed features. Use ''unknown'' if unknown.

 * '''Version''': What Squid version(s) will get this feature?

 * '''Priority''': How important on a scale of 0 to 5 is this for the developer working on it?

 * '''Developer''': Who is responsible for this feature? Use wiki names for developers who have a home page on this wiki.
