= Feature: IPv6 =

 * '''Goal''': Support IPv6 clients, servers, peers, and resolvers.
 * '''Status''': In progress
 * '''ETA''': Squid 3.0 Release + 7 days
 * '''Version''': Squid 3.1
 * '''Developer''': AmosJeffries
 * '''More''': http://devel.squid-cache.org/squid3-ipv6/

All initial goals for this feature have been completed along with many others found on the way. Full IPv6 support is almost complete. While not itself in feature-freeze, the emphasis has turned to bugs. Remaining features will now be converted by request as needed, or slowly in the regular process of code cleanup. The branch is now waiting only on Squid 3.0 Release before its merged into Squid 3.1.
