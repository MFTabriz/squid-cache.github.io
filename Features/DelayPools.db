If you want it to be able to respond to a burst, increase the aggregate_max to a larger value, and traffic bursts will be handled.  It is recommended that the maximum is at least twice the restore value - if there is only a single object being downloaded, sometimes the download rate will fall below the requested throughput as the bucket is not empty when it comes to be replenished. </para></section><section><title>How to limit a single connection to 128 Kbps?</title><para>You can not limit a single HTTP request's connection speed.

To limit a specific host, define an <emphasis><ulink url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/acl#">acl</ulink></emphasis> for that host and use the example above.  To limit a group of hosts, then you must use a delay pool of class 2 or 3.  For example: </para><screen><![CDATA[acl only128kusers src 192.168.1.0/24

Also, users of the main Unix system are allowed to choose slow or fast traffic, but must pay for any traffic they do using the fast cache.  Ident lookups are disabled for accesses through the slow cache since they aren't needed. Slow accesses are delayed using a class 3 delay pool to give fairness between departments as well as between users.  We recognize users of Lynx on the main host are grouped together in one delay bucket but they are mostly viewing text pages anyway, so this isn't considered a serious problem.  If it was we could take those hosts into a class 1 delay pool and give it a larger allocation. </para><para>I prefer using a slow restore rate and a large maximum rate to give preference to people who are looking at web pages as their individual bucket fills while they are reading, and those downloading large objects are disadvantaged.  This depends on which clients you believe are more important.  Also, one individual 8 bit network (a residential college) have paid extra to get more bandwidth. </para><para>The relevant parts of my configuration file are (IP addresses, etc, all changed): </para><screen><![CDATA[# ACL definitions
