== Details ==

We still are HTTP/1.0, not 1.1. There is many reasons to this but lets begin with the major ones

 * Internal forwarding path do not handle 1XX messages very well
 * Chunked encoding missing (patch available).
To complete this work is needed in the following areas:
 * Store API and data flow, to enable forwarding of 1xx responses. And maybe to give some thought on how to proxy transfer encodings (i.e. gzip) without having to recode.
 * Protocol parsing & composing for transfer encoding (at minimum chunked).

== Related minor tasks ==

Additionally work should also be done in the following

 * Cleanups to comply better with the RFCs.
 * Implement cache invalidation requirements.

== Older notes ==

Copied from ["Features/Other"]:

Some thought will need to be put into the following areas:

 * HTTP entity types
 * HTTP range requests
