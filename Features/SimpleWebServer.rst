= Feature: Add simple WebServing capabilites? =

## Move this down into the details documentation when feature is complete.
 * '''Goal''': Squid already has simple web-serving capabilites, e.g. error-pages, icons, etc. They are mostly hard-coded and served from memory. It would make sense to add simple webserving capabilities for generic content, and fold this static content back in.

 * '''Status''': ''Not started''

## Remove this entry once the feature has been merged into trunk.
##  it will then be auto-listed in the RoadMap completed features for its Version
 * '''ETA''': ''unknown''

 * '''Version''': 3.3

 * '''Priority''': 

 * '''Developer''': 

 * '''More''': Imported from [[http://www.squid-cache.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1059|Bug 1059]]
