= Feature: Collapsed Forwarding =
## * '''Goal''': This work aims at providing optimized request forwarding for accelerator setups by collapsing multiple requests for the same object into one backend server request.

 * '''Status''': completed in 2.6, 2.7, and ported to [[Squid-3.5]]

 * '''Version''': 2.6+ and 3.5+

 * '''Developer''': HenrikNordstrom, AlexRousskov

 * '''More''': Bugs Bug:1614 and Bug:3495

== Details ==
This performance enhancement feature enables multiple client requests for the same URI to be processed as one request to the backend server. Normally disabled to avoid increased latency on dynamic content, but there can be benefit from enabling this in accelerator setups where the web servers are the bottleneck but are reliable and return mostly cacheable information.

It was left out of [[Squid-3.0]] due to time and stability constraints. The SquidConf:max_stale part of this feature was added to [[Squid-3.2]], SquidConf:collapsed_forwarding part to [[Squid-3.5]], SquidConf:refresh_stale_hit is still awaiting re-implementation.

 {i} The ''stale-while-revalidate'' part of the original [[Squid-2.6]] feature has since been turned into an official HTTP/1.1 extension by RFC RFC:5861. The protocol header should now be used instead of the squid configuration option.


== Documentation ==
In accelerator setups it is desirable if the number of connections to the backend web servers is minimized. However, Squid being designed primarily for forward proxy operation does not take this into consideration. As a result there may be storms of requests to the backend server if a very frequently accessed object expires from the cache or a new very frequently accessed object is added.

To remedy this situation this feature adds a new tuning knob (SquidConf::collapsed_forwarding) to squid.conf, making Squid delay further requests while a cache revalidation or cache miss is being resolved. This sacrifices general proxy latency in favor for accelerator performance and thus should not be enabled unless you are running an accelerator.

[[Squid-2.6]] and [[Squid-2.7]] in addition contain a '''stale-while-revalidate''' option on SquidConf:refresh_pattern to shortcut the cache revalidation of frequently accessed objects is added, making further requests immediately return as a cache hit while a cache revalidation is pending. This may temporarily give slightly stale information to the clients, but at the same time allows for optimal response time while a frequently accessed object is being revalidated. This too is an optimization only intended for accelerators, and only for accelerators where minimizing request latency is more important than freshness.

== Configuration ==
[[Squid-2.6]], [[Squid-2.7]], and [[Squid-3.5]]+:
{{{
collapsed_forwarding on
}}}
This option enables collapse of multiple requests for the same URI to be processed as one request. Normally disabled to avoid corner cases with hung requests, but there can be large benefit from enabling this in accelerator setups where the web servers are reliable.

[[Squid-2.6]] and [[Squid-2.7]] only:
{{{
refresh_stale_hit interval (default 0)
}}}
This option decreases latency on collapsed forwarding by initiating a revalidation request some time before the object becomes stale. This avoid having more than one client wait for the revalidation to finish.

== Internal Design ==
This effect is achieved by the following primary changes

 1. On cache misses the new object is made immediately public, allowing new requests to attach to the pending request. If the object is later found to be private then the attached requests will all detach and initiate new requests.
 1. On cache revalidations entry->mem_obj->ims_entry is set to the !StoreEntry of the IMS query, allowing additional requests to optionally attach to the same backend IMS query.
 1. To avoid objects which for one or another reason gets stuck and does not receive a reply in a timely fashion entry->mem_obj->refresh_timestamp is used to avoid objects which has been pending for IMS reply more than 30 seconds.
 1. The optional refresh_stale_window also uses the same refresh_timestamp field to keep track of if a revalidation has been initiated or not.

The stale_hit effect uses the same mechanism by disregarding that the object is stale if there is already a cache revalidation running (ims_entry set).

== Known issues and shortcomings ==
 * The 30 second window should be tuneable; see Bug Bug:2504.
 * At least in the 2.6 implementation, non-successful responses are not collapsed, leading to the potential for overwhelming the back-end server; see Bug Bug:1918.
 * Might even be suitable for the general Internet proxy situation, not only reverse proxies.
 * Fails to occur when memory-only cache is used and no cache_dir are present.
