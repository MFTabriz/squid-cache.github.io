= Squid Developer Meetups =

While the Squid project doesn't have (yet?) fixed-schedule meetings like other Free/Open Source Software projects, we try to meet up every now and then to plan future developments, or just to try and hang around together. Each such meeting has a page of its own:

 * AustraliaMeeting08, will be held in Sydney on August 17-18th 2008
 * BugSprintLateSeptember2006
 * BugSprintSeptember2006 held over IRC
 * CodeSprintOct2005 was held in Torino in October 2005
 * CodeSprintDec2004 in Stockholm
