How to email me? Google for "adrian chadd". Plenty of ways to contact me are available.

I work on Squid for fun. I'm employed as a network engineer currently rolling out QoS/VoIP to enterprises and fixing WAN networking issues. Simple stuff, but its fun. I'm also studying Psychology and Linguistics on the side; I need to complete my CCNA, CCDP and CCVP sometime in the next 6 months as part of my latest job; and somewhere I fit in sleep. So Squid is something I do for fun rather than because I'm using it in production anywhere.

My homepage can be found at http://www.creative.net.au/. Some old-ish squid related stuff can be found at http://www.squid-cache.org/~adrian/.
