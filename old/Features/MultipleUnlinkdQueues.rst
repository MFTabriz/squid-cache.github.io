 * '''Goal''': Currently there is a single global unlinkd queue. It's possibile that a slow disk fills it up, causing other store_dirs to starve and thus not free disk storage fast enough.

 * '''Status''': ''Not started''

 * '''ETA''': ''unknown''

 * '''Version''': 3.2

 * '''Priority''': 

 * '''Developer''': 

 * '''More''': Imported from Bugzilla [[Bug:1580|Bug 1580]]
