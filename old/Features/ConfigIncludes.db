The <emphasis role="strong">include</emphasis> option effectively recurses down into another file or set of files at the position of the include. </para><para><emphasis role="strong">include</emphasis> is an option like all, to be configured on a line of its own. </para><para>The basic config method is to explicitly include each external file into squid.conf where it should be processed. For example; </para><screen><![CDATA[http_port 3128
include /etc/squid/refresh_patterns.conf
include /etc/squid/peers.conf
