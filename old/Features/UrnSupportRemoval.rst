= URN Support Removal =

## Move this down into the details documentation when feature is complete.
 * '''Goal''': Squid has supported for a long time various URN features, but the technology just didn't fly, to the point that it's not even accepted by modern web browsers. In addition, most of the currently hardcoded practices can be easily achieved using different means, such as redirectors. Aim of the Feature is removing URN support code, except for what's needed to successfully parse URNs

 * '''Status''': ''Not started''

 * '''ETA''': ''unknown''

 * '''Version''': 3.2
