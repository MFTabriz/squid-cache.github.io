Its most distinguishing feature is its extreme flexibility (see <ulink url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/WhySquid/Features#">Features</ulink>,<ulink url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/WhySquid/SquidFaq#">SquidFaq</ulink>) and customizability (<ulink url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/WhySquid/ConfigExamples#">ConfigExamples</ulink>).
