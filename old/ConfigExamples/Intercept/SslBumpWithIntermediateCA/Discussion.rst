The wiki page describes the concepts but do not give a script or an example of implementation using generic ssl tools and libs such as openssl.
There are some details at: https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3426#c13
If someone have couple minutes to write an example of usage or implementation I believe that it is a must for a proxy to have a key replacement policy.
I have seen that some proxy servers have a month intermediate CA key replacement policy but it's up to the admin.
