This page covers the details involved with translating a specific piece of text. </para><section><title>HTML Tags</title><para>The translation of Squid is currently just a translation of the various HTML pages produced by Squid. This means; the error pages seen when things go wrong, most of the FTP pages dealing with file transfers and directory listings. </para><para>The text shown for translation may contain HTML markup. You should be careful to leave these codes in the translation unchanged. You should not be translating the text in a way that makes them removable. </para></section><section><title>Protocol Terminology</title><para>Squid deals with Internet Protocols. Sometimes pieces of these are shown in the text. They should not be removed. </para><para>There is an Internet RFC somewhere which requires each of these things to have a certain <emphasis role="strong">exact</emphasis> text. Some admin may be stuck trying to read the raw protocol and not find the <emphasis role="strong">se-no-stor</emphasis> tag anywhere when he should have been searching for <emphasis role="strong">if-not-cached</emphasis>. </para><para>If a language has other words which describe it meaningfully the best translations include a language description in brackets () or equivalent, immediately after the term itself. </para><para>Some examples of these actually seen in the pages are: </para><itemizedlist><listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">GET</emphasis> </para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">PUT</emphasis> </para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">Content-Length:</emphasis> </para></listitem><listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">if-not-cached</emphasis> </para></listitem></itemizedlist><para>Others may appear any time. </para><para>So an english translation might look like this: </para><screen><![CDATA[Original:   PUT failed
]]><![CDATA[
Translated: PUT (upload) failed]]></screen></section><section><title>% Code Tags</title><para>Squid uses codes starting with % to insert certain items into the text. </para><para>Please leave these in the translated message as they are important for accurate error reporting. Remember that the final translation is going to be installed in many different systems, your preferences for showing certain things may not apply elsewhere. </para><para>I have found that in most messages where they mix with text, the code usually represents a singular noun. (IP Address, URL,or Hostnames) </para><para>A reference of the available tags, if you need to know what one means to translate it properly. Can be found at <ulink url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/CustomErrors">Custom Errors Feature</ulink> </para></section><section><title>Language Dialects</title><para>The messages from Squid which you are looking at translating, are automatically negotiated with website visitors during their creation. </para><para>This means that the language they are translated into is very specific and we cannot accept a mix of dialects within a single coded .po translation file.  Each dialect whether within a language or between countries needs to be given its own code and translated separately. See the various English or Dutch codes for an example of what this means. </para><para>If you have any unusual situation with language and country combination or language variant combinations that is not already solved, please contact the translation maintainer for assistance. (<ulink url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations/Guidelines/AmosJeffries#">AmosJeffries</ulink> at present). </para></section><section><title>Special Language Display</title><para>Some languages require Right-to-Left or otherwise altered display instead of the standard HTML English Left-to-Right settings. This is currently achieved through the use of <emphasis role="strong">:lang()</emphasis> attributes in CSS. </para><para>To ensure compatibility with Squid-2 which does not natively perform the same CSS insertion as <ulink url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Translations/Guidelines/Squid-3.1#">Squid-3.1</ulink> these language settings are embedded directly into the templates and alterations need to be brought to the attention of the Squid Developers. </para></section></section><section><title>Submissions Outside the System</title><para>If you are truly against using the existing translation toolkit system we run. You have the option of locating the <emphasis role="strong">errpages.pot</emphasis> file in the squid source code. Translating it and sending it to the translation maintainer.
