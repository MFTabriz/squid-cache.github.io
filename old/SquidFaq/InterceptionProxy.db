First, if your proxy machine is already in the path of the packets (i.e. it is routing between your proxy users and the Internet) then you don't have to worry about this step as the Interception Caching should now be working.  This would be true if you install Squid on a firewall machine, or on a UNIX-based router.  If the cache is not in the natural path of the connections, then you have to divert the packets from the normal path to your cache host using a router or switch. </para><para>If you are using an external device to route the traffic to your Cache, there are multiple ways of doing this.

Apparently there are two bug reports raised in Cisco, but they are not available for public dissemination. </para><para>The problem occurs with o/s packets with more than 1472 data bytes.  If you try to ping a host with more than 1472 data bytes across a Cisco interface with the access-lists and ip policy route map, the icmp request will fail.  The packet will be fragmented, and the first fragment is checked against the access-list and rejected - it goes the &quot;normal path&quot; as it is an icmp packet - however when the second fragment is checked against the access-list it is accepted (it isn't regarded as an icmp packet), and goes to the action determined by the policy route map! </para><para><ulink url="mailto:John.Saunders@scitec.com.au">John</ulink> notes that you may be able to get around this bug by carefully writing your access lists. If the last/default rule is to permit then this bug would be a problem, but if the last/default rule was to deny then it won't be a problem.  I guess fragments, other than the first, don't have the information available to properly policy route them. Normally TCP packets should not be fragmented, at least my network runs an MTU of 1500 everywhere to avoid fragmentation.  So this would affect UDP and ICMP traffic only. </para><para>Basically, you will have to pick between living with the bug or better performance.

WCCP is a dynamic service in which a cache engine communicates to a router about it's status, and based on that the router decides whether or not to redirect the traffic.  This means that if your cache becomes unavailable, the router will automatically stop attempting to forward traffic to it and end users will not be affected (and likely not even notice that your cache is out of service). </para><para>WCCPv1 is documented in the Internet-Draft <ulink url="http://www.web-cache.com/Writings/Internet-Drafts/draft-forster-wrec-wccp-v1-00.txt">draft-forster-wrec-wccp-v1-00.txt</ulink> and WCCPv2 is documented in <ulink url="http://www.web-cache.com/Writings/Internet-Drafts/draft-wilson-wrec-wccp-v2-00.txt">draft-wilson-wrec-wccp-v2-00.txt</ulink>. </para><para>For WCCP to work, you firstly need to configure your Squid Cache, and additionally configure the host OS to redirect the HTTP traffic from port 80 to whatever port your Squid box is listening to the traffic on.  Once you have done this you can then proceed to configure WCCP on your router. </para><section><title>Does Squid support WCCP?</title><para>Cisco's Web Cache Coordination Protocol V1.0 and WCCPv2 are both supported in all current versions of Squid. </para></section><section><title>Do I need a cisco router to run WCCP?</title><para>No.  Originally WCCP support could only be found on cisco devices, but some other network vendors now support WCCP as well.

If this happens, a TCP ACK from the client host may be sent to the origin server, instead of being diverted to the cache.  The origin server, upon receiving an unexpected ACK packet, sends a TCP RESET back to the client, which aborts the client's request. </para><para>To work around this problem, you can install a static route to the <emphasis>null0</emphasis> interface for the cache address with a higher metric (lower precedence), such as 250. </para><para>Then, when the link goes down, packets from the client just get dropped instead of sent out the default route.
