I joined the Squid development community in January 2007 intending to
just complete a then-partial
[IPv6](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/AmosJeffries/Features/IPv6#) feature
branch and was promoted to the Core Developer team mid-May of that year.
Being the sucker that I am, I also tripped my way into the position of
release maintainer for Squid-3 early in 2008, then kicked off the
[Translation
Project](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/AmosJeffries/Translations#) a few
months later.

I run an IT Consulting business [](http://www.treenet.co.nz); Treehouse
Networks Ltd. in New Zealand. Which provides customers from around the
world with a web hosting, email and content delivery network (CDN) built
with Squid.

A few bits and pieces about Squid including
[PayPal](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/AmosJeffries/PayPal#) donations to
me can be found at [](http://www.treenet.co.nz/projects/squid/)
