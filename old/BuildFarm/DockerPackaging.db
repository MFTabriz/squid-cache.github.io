Since <ulink url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/BuildFarm/DockerPackaging/RedHat#">RedHat</ulink> and other distributions made it possible to build and pack software in their &quot;Software Collections&quot; There is no real need for me to build Squid every time a release is out. </para><para>Since my web service is being abused by many on the Internet I decided to &quot;Offload&quot; the build service to others. </para><para>I have created a repository which contains docker build nodes for x86_64(Only) that might work on other platforms. </para><para><ulink url="https://github.com/elico/squid-docker-build-nodes"/> </para><para>This build system has been tested a lot but due to the migration from VM's to Docker it requires re-evaluation. </para><para>I am planning to stop my build nodes and my repository hosting services in the next couple month to a year. For now there is a QOS system on my service and for instructions on how to access these try: <ulink url="http://gogs.ngtech.co.il:9001/NgTech-LTD/ngtech-connect"/> </para><para>If you are interested in funding these, contact me on my mobile or email. </para></section></article>
