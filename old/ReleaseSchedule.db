The day-of-the-week choice is based on a Squid maintainer requirement. If that requirement changes, the dates will be adjusted (well in advance) by up to seven days in either direction. </para><para>A numbered vN branch is considered beta until it is declared stable. There will be no beta branch for the first 18 months of each two-year release cycle, reducing porting and maintenance overheads. The master branch will always be available for testing, of course.  </para><para>The tabulated events are nearly instantaneous and should occur (or be deemed occurred) at the beginning of the corresponding day (T00:00:00) in maintainer time zone. After the event, any commits on the corresponding branch must follow <ulink url="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/ReleaseSchedule/ReleaseProcess#">ReleaseProcess</ulink> policies designated to that branch status. The corresponding numbered release should occur as soon as possible after the tabulated event; the maintainer may need about 20 hours (or more) to complete all the required release-making steps. </para><para>This release schedule does not affect the master branch and any daily snapshots. </para><para>As we gain more experience with these regularly scheduled releases, and as our QA abilities improve, we may decide to shorten the release cycle (e.g., from two to one year) and/or adjust beta duration (e.g., from six to three or nine months). If that happens, the dates after August 1, 2021 and/or the corresponding release numbers may change. </para></section></article>
