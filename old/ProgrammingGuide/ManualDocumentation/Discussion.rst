## Please begin your contribution with "----" and an anchor for C# (incrementing the number for each comment) and end it with "-- FrancescoChemolli <<DateTime(2010-01-11T10:30:11Z)>>"
## this will help for references. Append to discussion at the bottom of the page.
## You can quote using
## {{{

<<Anchor(C1)>>
I like the idea. Would it be possible to have a complete template page attached to the wiki entry? It would make starting to write stuff easier.
