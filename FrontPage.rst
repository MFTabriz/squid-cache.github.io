 * Release [[RoadMap|plans]]
 * Configuration [[ConfigExamples|examples]] (WCCPv2, NTLM authentication, etc.)
 * Wiki [[SiteNavigation|navigation]]

=== Popular topics ===
 * [[KnowledgeBase/PerformanceAnalysis|Performance Analysis]]: "Help! My users complain that the proxy is slow!"

 * [[NTLMIssues]]: Things you can (and cannot) do with NTLM
 * ZeroSizedReply: Recurrent issues with some setups.

== Site News ==

 * <<Date(2008-12-08T23:46:37Z)>> The Squid Wiki is now also reachable using IPv6, at the URL http://eu6.squid-cache.org/, running Squid 3.1.0 as a front-end reverse proxy. An IPv6 record will be added within a few weeks for the main URL. If you run a v6-enabled client, please try using the test URL and report any issues to FrancescoChemolli

== Developers corner ==

DeveloperResources section has instructions for [[Squid3VCS|Bazaar]] and [[CvsInstructions|CVS]] access, coding guidelines, and other useful documentation.

Every now and then we try to organize some [[MeetUps|events, developer meetups or code sprints]]. In the MeetUps page you'll find schedules, notes and other event-related documentation.
