= Squid Proxy Web Cache Wiki =

This is a wiki dedicated to hosting documentation, hints and assorted notes about the Squid Web Cache. Eventually it will host the Squid FAQ and assorted documentation.

= Hotmail and IE6 Issue With Interception Proxies =
Recent changes at Hotmail.com and within IE6 has led to some users receiving a blank page in response to a login request when browsing through a proxy operating in interception, or transparent, mode. This is thought to be due to Internet Explorer 6 sending a syntactically incorrect Accept-Encoding header for requests to Hotmail.com.

A workaround is simply to add the following three lines to /etc/squid/squid.conf: {{{acl hotmail_domains dstdomain .hotmail.msn.com
acl ie6 browser MSIE[[:space:]]6
header_access Accept-Encoding deny ie6 hotmail_domains}}}
