= Squid Proxy Web Cache Wiki =

This is a wiki dedicated to hosting documentation, hints and assorted notes about the Squid Web Cache. Eventually it will host the Squid FAQ and assorted documentation.

= Hotmail and IE6 Issue With Interception Proxies =
Recent changes at Hotmail.com and has led to some users receiving a blank page in response to a login request when browsing through a proxy operating in interception, or transparent, mode. This is due to Hotmail incorrectly responding with Transfer-Encoding encoded response when the HTTP/1.0 request has an Accept-Encoding header. (Transfer-Encoding absolutely REQUIRES HTTP/1.1 and is forbidden within HTTP/1.0)

A workaround is simply to add the following three lines to /etc/squid/squid.conf: {{{acl hotmail_domains dstdomain .hotmail.msn.com
header_access Accept-Encoding deny hotmail_domains}}}

(para-quoted from http://www.swelltech.com/news.html for the concise summary)
