== Squid 3.1 ==

The set of new Squid 3.1 features has not been determined yet. The set will determine the release timeline. To minimize noise and the number of half-baked abandoned features, two feature sets are established: TODO List and Wish List.

== Squid 3.2 ==

The set of new Squid 3.2 features has not been determined yet. The set will determine the release timeline. To minimize noise and the number of half-baked abandoned features, two feature sets are established: TODO List and Wish List.


== TODO List ==

TODO List features determine the release focus and timeline.

TODO features must document their desired effect and estimated development time. Each feature must have a known active developer behind it. The developer must be ready to spend the time to fully develop the proposed feature (i.e., write, test, document, commit, and provide initial support).

Once Squid 3.1 release timeline is agreed upon, developers must obey it or move their feature to the next Squid release.

== Wish List ==

The Wish List accumulates features that do not meet the strict TODO List criteria. Many of these features can be implemented if there is enough demand. Some may get implemented outside of the official process, submitted as patches, and accepted into the release.
