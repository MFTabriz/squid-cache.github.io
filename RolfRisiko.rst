Im just an Linux-/Networkadmin trying to help as much people i can. I work with squid since 2011, and i love it.<<BR>>
Part of my daily tasks is to deploy, maintenance and monitor our proxy "farms", wich i really enjoy.
I like working in small Teams, and i play around with squid almost at least two times a week.
Feel free to contact me, i will answer as soon as possible.
